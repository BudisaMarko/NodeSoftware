------------------

**Version numbers**. As of now, we introduce version numbers for both the standards (XSAMS, VAMDC-TAP, see separate documentation) and for their implementation in the NodeSoftware which is the concern of this document. Version numbers follow the format YY.MMrX where YY is for the year, MM the month, and X an increasing number for bugfix revisions that do not affect the usage of the NodeSoftware.

The most important changes from the perspective of a node-operator who wants to upgrade to this `11.5` release are:

**Update to Django 1.3**. The NodeSoftware now requires Django version 1.3 and node operators probably need to upgrade their installation of Django. See :ref:`upgrading`.

**Email**. Make sure you have set a correct email address in ``settings.py``. It will be used to report critical errors to, including reports on what went wrong.

**Logging**. The capabilities to log debug and error-messages have been extended. See :ref:`logging`. 

**Example query**. As soon as a node becomes operational, please add an example query to its ``settings.py``. It will be used for automated testing. Example::

    EXAMPLE_QUERY = 'SELECT ALL WHERE RadTransWavelength > 4000 AND RadTransWavelength < 4005'

**Volume estimate**. In order to allow the portal (and other queries to your node) to find out how big the resulting XML-output for a particular query will be, nodes should estimate this and relay it via the new HTTP-header `VAMDC-APPROX-SIZE`. The easiest way to do this is to run a test query, determine the outputs size (in MB) and divide it by the number of items (e.g. transitions, if these dominate your results). This number can then be used to estimate the size of any query, see the updated example at :ref:`queryfu`.

**Other Header changes**. The header `VAMDC-COUNT-SPECIES` has been replaced by `VAMDC-COUNT-ATOMS` and `VAMDC-COUNT-MOLECULES`. See the standards documentation for the full definition.

**Error handling in urls.py**. The NodeSoftware has become more error-safe
and tries to handle unexected input and "crashes" more gracefully. You need not care about this, excpet making sure that the following two lines are present at the end of the file ``urls.py`` in your node's main directory::

    handler500 = 'vamdctap.views.tapServerError'
    handler404 = 'vamdctap.views.tapNotFoundError'

**Dictionary changes**. Since the XSAMS-schema has changed, so have the
dictionary keywords, especially in the Broadening-part of radiative transitions
and the atomic quantum numbers. Also new keywords have been added for the bits
that are newly implemented in the XML-generator.

**Stricter format for accuracies**. In compliance with XSAMS' new way of
defining a value's accuracy, the keywords that are not explicity given for
`DataTypes` have become more. Any word `SomeKeyword` that is marked as a
`DataType` in the dictionary allows for use of the following words as well:
SomeKeywordUnit, SomeKeywordRef, SomeKeywordComment, SomeKeywordMethod,
SomeKeywordAccuracyCalibration, SomeKeywordAccuracyQuality,
SomeKeywordAccuracySystematic, SomeKeywordAccuracySystematicConfidence,
SomeKeywordAccuracySystematicRelative, SomeKeywordAccuracyStatistical,
SomeKeywordAccuracyStatisticalConfidence,
SomeKeywordAccuracyStatisticalRelative, SomeKeywordAccuracyStatLow,
SomeKeywordAccuracyStatLowConfidence, SomeKeywordAccuracyStatLowRelative,
SomeKeywordAccuracyStatHigh, SomeKeywordAccuracyStatHighConfidence,
SomeKeywordAccuracyStatHighRelative. See also the standards documentation.

.. note::

    The last two points mean that you probably have to update your ``dictionaries.py``.

March 10, 2011
------------------

The chapter :ref:`concepts` now has more detail on the XSAMS schema.

A large part of the XML/XSAMS generator has been rewritten, both to comply with
the new version of the schema (http://tmy.se/xsams) and in terms of its
structure. In addition the keywords in the VAMDC dictionary have changed
somewhat. This means that **you will probably need to update your query
function and dictionaries when you update the NodeSoftware.**

:ref:`newnode` has been updated and extended accordingly.

A new version of the :ref:`virtmach` has also been uploaded,
containing the latest NodeSoftware and operating system.

February 2011
-----------------

The deployment of nodes is now covered in more detail at :ref:`deploy`.

Known limitations
==================

To be addressed in the 11.8 release

* The "Cases" for molecular quantum numbers are not yet implemented in the XSAMS-generator (but can be included with the hook for custom XML).
* Tools for treating certain Restrictables as special cases for a flexible.
* Atom Component's Configurations are not yet fully defined in the XSAMS schema.
