Changelog
=================

March 10, 2011
------------------

The chapter :ref:`concepts` now has more detail on the XSAMS schema.

A large part of the XML/XSAMS generator has been rewritten, both to comply with
the new version of the schema (http://tmy.se/xsams) and in terms of its
structure. In addition the keywords in the VAMDC dictionary have changed
somewhat. This means that **you will probably need to update your query
function and dictionaries when you update to the latest version.**

:ref:`newnode` has been updated and extended accordingly.

February 2011
-----------------

The deployment of nodes is now covered in more detail at :ref:`deploy`.
