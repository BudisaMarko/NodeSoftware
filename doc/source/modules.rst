The Code
================

The node software resides at https://github.com/VAMDC/NodeSoftware

For upgrades, please see :ref:`upgrading`.

You can download a zip or tar.gz archive from this website or - 
preferrably - use the version control software *git* to check out your own 
copy. The latter takes a few more minutes to set up but has the benefit 
of facilitating collaboration. After all, you might makes changes or 
extend the code for your needs and we would like to include your 
improvements into the main repository.
