Bugs and Contact
====================

Report a bug
--------------------

The NodesoftWare is still in active development and there are some rough edges
still. Sometimes things break, others are not yet implemented. We very much
appreciate your feedback and complaints are usually resolved quickly.

Please file an issue at https://github.com/VAMDC/NodeSoftware/issues

This can be used for bugs on both, the software itself and the documentation.

Contact information

You can send a message to the admin of the NodeSoftware on GitHub:

For email, please write to thomas.marquart <AT> astro.uu.se
