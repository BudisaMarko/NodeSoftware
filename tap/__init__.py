"""
Tools to query the TAP-interface of DSA/catalog.
It's a asynchronous request and the replies are XML
documents (that can be tranformed into html).

The scripts sends a (hardcoded) request to my
DSA/catalog installation with VALD data. It then
tells DSA to run the query, checks if it has completed
and fetches the result.

Not yet working: read the result into ATPy's implementation
of VOTable.
