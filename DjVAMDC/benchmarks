2010-04-21 running on melkor, djangos test-server (single thread),
once with sqlite backend, once with mysql same import in both
databases, same indexes

query all Fe transitions, 3000 < Ã… < 3500, plus corresponging 
states, species, references:

sqlite -> xsams:  45 sec,   4.5  MB ( 0.21 gzipped)
sqlite -> csv:    45  sec,  0.7 MB ( 0.14 gzipped)
mysql -> xsams:  79,40,38  sec,  size see above
mysql -> csv:  50,37 sec,  size see above

Run time with mysql goes down after first request - I suspect clever
caching. these numbers also mean that the query is the bottle neck,
not the creation of XML. However creating xsams might need more
advanced queries to the db - thereby increasing overhead...
