<p> This is a test implementation. It consists of
two parts that are run by independent web-applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>portal</strong> which is the VAMDC "central" that is
supposed to let users <a href="/portal/query/">make a data request</a>
without knowing about individual databases, to pass this request to
the connected databases and to collect the results to be displayed or
downloaded to the user. All URLs that contain <em>/portal/</em> are
run by this application.</li>
<li>The <strong>nodes</strong> which represent a data set, typically a
database, with software running on top of it that allows
communication with the portal. Nodes have URLs with <em>/node/</em>
and as you can see, there is currently just
one: <a href="/node/vald">VALD</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Even though both applications
(<em>/portal/</em> and <em>/node/</em>) run on the same server for
test purposes, there is no "cheating" in the sense that they share
running code. They only communicate via standard HTTP-interfaces which
are important parts to be developed and tested.
